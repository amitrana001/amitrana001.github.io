<h2>Abstract</h2>
Most state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods rely on large amounts of pixel-precise ground-truth annotations
for training, which are expensive to create. Interactive segmentation networks help generate such annotations based
on an image and the corresponding user interactions such as clicks. Existing methods for this task can only process
a single instance at a time and each user interaction requires a full forward pass through the entire deep network.
We introduce a more efficient approach, called DynaMITe, in which we represent user interactions as spatio-temporal
queries to a Transformer decoder with a potential to segment multiple object instances in a single iteration. Our
architecture also alleviates any need to re-compute image features during refinement, and requires fewer interactions
for segmenting multiple instances in a single image when compared to other methods. DynaMITe achieves state-of-
the-art results on multiple existing interactive segmentation benchmarks, and also on the new multi-instance benchmark
that we propose in this paper.
